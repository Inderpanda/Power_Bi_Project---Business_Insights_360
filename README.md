- Dataset Understanding

Dimension table: It will have static data like details of customers and products
Fact table: It will have the data about the transactions

Importing data into PowerBi
As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential

Data Model
- Data modelling plays a vital role and is considered the basement of the report. All the visuals will be built upon the data model.
- Poor data modelling affects the overall performance of the report.
- Following Good practices of data modelling is a must. Refer to this page to get to know the good practices of Blog
- In this project, we have followed the Snowflake data modeling method.
